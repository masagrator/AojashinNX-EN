					"name": "??",

				},
				{
					"name": "Will",

				{
					"name": "Rob",

				},
				{

					"text": "Really now?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "He married many women, apparently. Bigamy is prohibited in this country, right? All but his first marriage became null and void."
				},
				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "Whoa, that's incredible."
				},
				{
					"text": "Those vows before God that not even the Queen could do anything about."
				},
				{
					"text": "And in the end, it was the law of this land that protected Olivia?"
				},
				{
					"text": "The very same laws that made us suffer so..."

				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "How rude of that hedonistic baboon. And here I was swearing in front of God. He made a bloody liar of me!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Will",

				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "Of course I did."
				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "So, is that the stage you prepared for me? A rather paltry offering, I must admit."
				},
				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "It's not that bad when you're on it."
				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",

				},
				{

				},
				{

					"text": "Now, that is what I wanted to hear."
				},
				{
					"text": "To celebrate our reunion with Olivia, we drink like there's no morrow."
				},
				{
					"text": "We started in the evening, but the merriment showed no sign of slowing down even as we hit midnight."
				},
				{
					"text": "Everyone, me included, thought she was out of our lives, so it makes sense."
				},
				{
					"text": "My head is spinning, and I can barely feel my legs."
				},
				{
					"text": "My tongue feels heavy, and my head is throbbing already."
				},
				{
					"text": "But man, those were the best drinks of my life."
				},
				{
					"text": "We close up the store and go upstairs. In a flight of fancy, I pull a ladder out of the storeroom and climb up to the roof."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's the first time I've been here since Dad lost his sight."
				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",

				{
					"text": "She deftly raises her glass of wine to her full lips and takes a sip."

				{
					"text": "The lights shining from the house next door highlight her captivating figure."
				},
				{

				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "I'm captivated by her, sipping on my ale as I gaze at the woman of my dreams."
				},
				{
					"text": "She looks off into the distance for a while, until she turns around and notices my intent gaze."
				},
				{
					"text": "Then she quirks a wolfish smile."
				},
				{

				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "Not being separated forever makes for a very lousy tragedy, wouldn't you say?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "We went and ruined all the emotion of our final parting. Now I just feel stupid for all the tears I shed on my way out."

					"text": "You cried?"
				},
				{
					"text": "When I say that, Olivia directs the mother of all glares at me."

				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "Obviously! But you were in such a state that I decided to hold my tears until I was alone."
				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "Did I cry? Did you really just ask me that? Perhaps you're not as good a bard as I thought you were."

				},
				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "I don't know about that..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "Then say something sensible for once! How about making me feel like I finally came back to the arms of my beloved poet instead of a lousy potato smasher?! Would you mind?"
				},
				{
					"text": "The alcohol is making the world spin around me."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "I raise a finger in front of my eyes to try and give me a faint sense of balance."
				},
				{
					"text": "Before I begin, a hiccup escapes my mouth. Not the best start, admittedly."
				},
				{
					"text": "Olivia lowers her eyebrows in a show of contempt, but her smile doesn't diminish one bit."
				},
				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "You speak true when you say it would make for a lousy tragedy. It is a travesty of the highest order."
				},
				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "For a couple to shed bitter tears as they separate only to be reunited not even a moon hence would be a disappointment. Not even worth putting to paper, really."
				},
				{
					"text": "Olivia slightly tilts her head to the side and waits for me to continue."
				},
				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "However... We are not here to live out beautiful stories."
				},
				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "Even if it's a disgraceful conclusion, even if it's a story that would be met with the rolling eyes of an audience, I am truly ecstatic to see you again."
				},
				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "I cannot lie to my own heart of hearts. This is how it should be. If I can spend my life with you, I have no regrets."

				},
				{
					"text": "She extends one hand to me."

					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "If I can feel the burning heat I felt in your arms that night once again, I may yet be convinced I'm not just under Orpheus' little spell."
				},
				{
					"text": "Her enchanting eyes draw me in as she suggestively flutters her lashes."
				},
				{
					"text": "I take her hand with mine, pull her into my arms, and meet her welcoming lips with my own."
				},
				{
					"text": "Olivia leans into me without a second's hesitation, entrusting herself into me."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wrap an arm around her lovely waist and pull her closer into me."

					"text": "I feel her against me, just like the day we parted."
				},
				{
					"text": "After a long while, we reluctantly part the kiss."
