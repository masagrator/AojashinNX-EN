				},
				{
					"text": "Thinking it might be Rin, I hurry to pick it up."
				},
				{

				},
				{

					"text": "Arishima? Thank goodness, you actually picked up this time."
				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "Where are you, man?! You left your bag in the faculty and all. I told them you had a medical emergency."
				},

				},
				{

					"text": "All right."
				},
				{
					"text": "Watanabe arrives at the entrance about thirty minutes later."

				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "Ah, there it is. There should be a bunch of letters and numbers written on the back of that box over there. Can you read them out for me?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Watanabe says, as he sits down and pulls a laptop out of his bag."
				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "There we go. The search history's stored on the router."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "What are you doing?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "Okay, so simply put, I can see the records of whatever sites were visited using this network."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Okay?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "Mmh... What's this? Wonder why she looked up so many tutorials about preparing horse mackerel."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Probably has nothing to do with this. Can you check more recent stuff?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "Okay. Hmm, it looks like she visited the website of a maternity clinic last week."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Really?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "This one."
