				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "So that was you! Hahah! You could have told me earlier."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I thought it would have been a little audacious of me. You must have seen many thousands of students through the years."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "So that was the day. I remember it very well. You left a big impression on me back then."
				},
				{

				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Yonagi?"
				},
				{

					"text": "I never knew!"
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Mm?"
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Do you know much about her family?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Nothing at all, actually. That's why we got into an argument when I learned she used to be a midsider."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Of the heated variety?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I always thought she dreamed of becoming a midsider like me."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "But we lived all these years together, and I never knew she had actually been there before."
				},
				{

					"text": "Destiny?"
				},
				{

					"text": "There's something I need to show you."
				},
				{
					"text": "A nostalgic smile plays about his face as he goes over his desk, takes a photo frame from it, and comes over to sit in front of me."
				},
				{
					"text": "He holds the frame out to me."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "What's this?"
				},
				{
					"text": "He smiles at me and nods encouragingly."
				},
				{

				},
				{

					"text": "That's... you."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "The picture was taken here?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Yes. This was taken over twenty years ago."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "That's a long time ago."
				},
				{
					"text": "That said, he doesn't look a day older today than he does in this picture."

				},
				{
					"text": "This man..."
				},
				{

					"text": "Is he Yonagi's..."
				},
				{

				},
				{

					"text": "Her father..."
				},

					"name": "Asuma",

				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Shiona... He was a researcher?"
				},
				{
					"text": "The professor nods again."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "So that's why Yonagi was a midsider..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Because her father was a researcher?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Back then, she lived here in the middle side with Shiona and his wife. She was barely more than a baby at the time."
				},
				{
					"text": "Her father was a researcher like me?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Why would Yonagi keep this from me?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Well, it must be hard for her to speak of the topic. I ask that you try not to resent her for keeping it a secret."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "What do you mean? Why would it be hard?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Her father was an immensely talented researcher. So much so, in fact, that I found myself jealous of his prowess more often than not."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "Professor Asuma has spoken previously of a researcher he once knew. The only person he would call a genius, I recall."
				},
				{
					"text": "So that was him."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "So the person you founded the lab with..."
				},
				{
					"text": "He nods again, a glimmer of pride shining in his eyes."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "That's him. The lion's share of the credit for building the foundation of the virtual space system we work on falls to him. I was mostly just making hardware adjustments."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Not to say I was shoddy at my job, but compared with his mastery of the theory and uncanny understanding of the sensory feedback processing, I was working on intern-level tasks."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "He's the one responsible for the foundation of the software that you are developing further now."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "...I see."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "But he was unable to keep working on his research, and he and Yonagi got ranked down to lowsiders."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "He couldn't? What happened?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "He started forgetting everything. Eventually, he forgot even himself."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Himself?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I've read about the existence of such a brain condition that affected people on the surface from medical books."
				},
				{
					"text": "But this is the first time I've heard of a case like that down here."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "As to whether his condition was simply a natural occurrence, or the side effect of using himself as a subject for lab trials time and time again..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "To this day, no one can tell. But not a day goes by where I don't think of the endless guilt I carry with me."
				},
				{
					"text": "He says, his gaze apparently miles away."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "You feel guilty for not noticing it was happening before it was too late?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "No..."
				},
				{
					"text": "The professor turns to me, his mouth settling into a hard line."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",

				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I see..."
				},
				{
					"text": "The professor fills the silence with a sip of his coffee."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "And the one person that stood by him to the end was Yonagi."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "But he... He didn't know who he was, let alone who the small girl by his bedside was."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "And he left this world like that, not knowing who anyone in his life was."
				},
				{
					"text": "I look down at my cup of coffee."
				},
				{
					"text": "Coffee gone cold, hardly appetizing."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I had no idea..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "So Yonagi rejected the idea of living here in the middle side?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I recall her sad expression once more."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I don't think she rejected it exactly. But she wasn't happy about it."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "She told me she wanted me to wait."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "She wanted to make sure of something before giving me her answer."
				},
				{
					"text": "And then, something clicks in my head."
				},
				{
					"text": "Why would she refuse moving with me to the middle side?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Why would she say it was because she got complacent?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I try to put all the pieces together and formulate a hypothesis."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Most people who live in the middle side are qualified to do so because of the work they perform."
				},
				{
					"text": "I halt my thoughts and turn back to him."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "When people lose their jobs, like Yonagi's father, they are ranked down to lowsiders."
				},
				{

				},

					"text": "She did? How?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "She remarried with another researcher."

					"text": "I stared at him, stunned."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "What? People can just do that?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "The system allows for divorce and remarriage. Moral implications aside, you can indeed do such a thing."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "All within the rules, of course."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "As for what is the right or wrong thing to do, or what a person ought to do and not do with their life, I cannot say."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",

				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Perhaps that's why she's so determined to appreciate life as a lowsider."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Maybe she doesn't want to admit that the way of life her mother so readily abandoned her for is worthless."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",

				},
				{

					"text": "There were several treatments, but they all served merely to alleviate the suffering of the patient. At the very least, humankind never found a definitive cure for it while on the surface."
