					"text": "It's a little crumpled from getting wet and drying out again, but it'll do. I pop it in my mouth, go to the kitchen, and light it up below the ventilation fan."

					"name": "Arishima",

				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",

				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "It made me feel like maybe, if there's someone out there who loves me so much, being alive a little longer wouldn't be so bad."
				},
				{
					"text": "Unable to find the words, I simply keep nodding in response."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "I felt your love in a deeper way than all the times you made love to me. Though I enjoyed that in its own right as well."
				},
				{
					"text": "She lets out a devilish giggle."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "...I'll get in shape so I can satisfy you."
				},
				{
					"text": "She nods, a sly grin spreading across her face."
				},
				{

					"text": "Nah."
				},
				{
					"text": "I shake my head."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "I haven't thought about it at all. To be honest, I feel like I've let everything I had bottled up inside out."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "When I was writing, I couldn't think about anything but the words before me, and you."
				},
				{
					"text": "She smiles."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "I haven't decided what to write, or if I'm even gonna write again at all."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "I think you should write."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "I'm sure you should."
				},
				{
					"text": "She sounds so matter of fact about it."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "If you could put your feelings to paper like that just to show them to me, I'm sure you can write anything."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "If you found a message that made you feel strongly enough, I'm sure you could write something that would appeal to the general public instead of just me."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "But I don't have a message that would interest the general public like you say."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "That's a lie if I've ever heard one. Right here in these pages, you wrote about so many things in life you're dissatisfied with."
				},
				{
					"text": "She points to the manuscript."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{

					"text": "I stare into her eyes."

				{

				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "I think you can write. I think you should. I'm sure you could write some good stuff."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "Because I'm the daughter of a famous writer?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I shake my head."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Because you're that kind of person. Your blood has nothing to do with it."
				},
				{
					"text": "She giggles and gives me a small nod."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "I think you should. And more than that, I want to read it."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "But..."

				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "If you write, I'll write. Sounds like a fair exchange to me."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "You really think I can do it?"
				},

					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "I know you can."

				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "..."

				},
				{
					"text": "Then she quirks the corners of her mouth and gives me a mischievous smile."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "So, say I do manage to write something... I'd like a reward for my effort."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Really now?"
				},
				{
					"text": "She nods."
				},
				{

					"text": "Well, if I can make it happen, then sure."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "You've gotta submit your next work for a rookie award."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "..."

				{
					"text": "She gives me another one of those smug, sly looks."

				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "What?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "Put something on. You're gonna get me all hot and bothered remembering last night."

					"text": "Are you doing it on purpose?"

				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Oh..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I clear my throat."
				},
				{
					"text": "At the ripe old age of 45, I find myself clearing my throat after being caught with my pants down, literally."
				},
				{
					"text": "I use the washing machine in Rin's house to clean my clothes. One single button press and it does all the work. Truly, we have come far as a species."
				},
				{
					"text": "After changing into my now clean clothes, I head to Shuho's studio to pick up my bag."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's still pretty early."
				},
				{
					"text": "I had lunch with Rin while I waited for my laundry to be done."

				{
					"text": "I think she's out shopping while I go get my stuff."
				},

				{
					"text": "My feet are so light they barely feel attached to me."
				},
				{
					"text": "I have so much to think about."
				},
				{
					"text": "I skipped work without explanation."

				},
				{
					"text": "And the woman I'm in the process of divorcing saw me locking arms with her."
				},
				{
					"text": "If I'm not careful, I might have a lot of explaining to do."
				},
				{
					"text": "The worries pile up and make me want to sigh, yet my heart feels radiant."
				},
				{
					"text": "Maybe the part of my brain that regulates anxiety is truly broken."
				},
				{
					"text": "Like a junkie in the middle of his high."
				},
				{
					"text": "But there is something that backs up this peppy spring in my step."
				},
				{

				{
					"text": "Despite my obvious lack of morals, I'm a grown man."
				},
				{
					"text": "I know that her fiery passion won't last forever."
				},
				{
					"text": "But that's fine."
				},
				{
					"text": "It doesn't deter the happiness I'm feeling."

					"text": "When I take my first step inside the studio I freeze, stunned."

				{
					"text": "Was the air in this place always so stagnant?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Did I really find this space comfortable?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I shudder."
				},
				{
					"text": "My stench after spending all that time here unwashed hangs like grime clinging to a wall."

				},
				{
					"text": "No one can stay in this place."
				},
				{
					"text": "That's what my instincts tell me."
				},
				{
					"text": "I feel the stomach-churning fear of a person who unknowingly crosses a flimsy log bridge with a blindfold on, only to look back and realize how lucky he was."
				},
				{
					"text": "One wrong step, and I would have been dead."
				},
				{

					"text": "Hatano Shuho wasn't the perfect man I thought him to be."
				},
				{
					"text": "But the power of his writing was the real deal."
				},
				{
					"text": "His memories have the power to pull the reader into the same state of mind that he was in."
				},
				{
					"text": "That's a power I don't have."

				{
					"text": "And I don't think I want it anymore."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't want to make Rin feel even an ounce of the suffering I did."
				},
				{
					"text": "I want to deliver her a story of salvation, even if it's make-believe."
				},
				{
					"text": "Even if it's not to remain with her for long, a story that could, just for a moment, light up her heart."

					"text": "I came out of the west exit of Shinjuku station into an office district, and found the hospital after walking for a while. It was on the fifth floor of a tall building."
				},
				{
					"text": "The doctor had long hair, and her features struck me as very neat and prim."
				},
				{
					"text": "Before I could tell her I wanted an abortion, she put on an ultrasound image of my stomach on the screen."
				},
				{

				{
					"text": "I was the only one who would mourn it."
				},
				{
					"text": "Lying on the bed, tears rolled down my face."
				},
				{
					"text": "After the ultrasound, the doctor explained the procedure for issuing a pregnancy certificate. As soon as she stopped talking, I told her that I wanted an abortion."
				},
				{
					"text": "I told her that I had no parents and that I couldn't get a consent form from the father. I asked her to book me in for an abortion as soon as possible."
				},
				{
					"text": "She nodded and informed me that it could be done as soon as tomorrow."
				},
				{
					"text": "She explained that, if it's what I want, it's better to abort as soon as possible."
				},
				{
					"text": "But if I change my mind, I'm free to cancel at any point, even on the day of the procedure. She asked me if I understood many times."
				},
				{
					"text": "I interjected with nods and got up from my seat after she was done explaining."
				},
				{
					"text": "She asked me I'd like to take a copy of the sonogram."
				},
				{
					"text": "The doctor got up after me and handed me the photo."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's just a little cluster of white dots contrasting against the black and gray of the background."
				},
				{
					"text": "I trace my fingers over the tiny white blobs. They're so small I would have overlooked them if it wasn't for the doctor being nice enough to mark them with her pen."
				},
				{
					"text": "This little life's whole world is me."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wonder if the woman who gave birth to me also looked at me like this. A little white dot in a sea of dark."
				},
				{
					"text": "What did she think, I wonder."
				},
				{
					"text": "Maybe she thought she could use it to entrap Hatano Shuho."
				},

				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "So they were pretty much the same when it came to amenities, but I never noticed before how much the thickness of the walls can change the ventilation and feeling a room has."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Given my budget, I may as well go for one of those instead of a high-rise."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "High-rise apartments have such low ceilings to hide all the steel beams, and I like high ceilings because they help the place feel less cramped."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "Oh, is that so?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "They also recommended something called weekly apartments. The procedure to rent one is easy, you don't need a lot of paperwork, and you can just give a down payment and not worry about annual income checks and all that."
				},
				{
					"text": "I triumphantly dump all the house hunting knowledge I acquired today on Rin while she's preparing stuff in the kitchen."
				},
				{
					"text": "She listens to all of it with a sweet smile on her face."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",

				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",

				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Oh? But you always cook proper—and delicious—meals."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",

				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "We celebrating something?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "No, not really. I just feel a little peckish today."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "Really?"

				},
				{
					"text": "She lived up to her word."
				},
				{
					"text": "A bunch of fancy looking dishes are lined up on the table today."
				},
				{
					"text": "There's medium rare steak slices, mashed potatoes, bean soup, and a bowl of salad."
				},
				{
					"text": "Even baguettes and butter."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Whoa, this really is a feast."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "Right?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "Don't you think you could go out with no regrets if this was our last supper?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Rin says, as she sits in front of me."
				},
				{
					"text": "That comment makes me think for a moment."

				{
					"text": "I nod."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",

				},
				{
					"text": "She nods."

				},
				{
					"text": "I nod in response."

					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "Yes."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "Right now we're in our little period of grace."
				},
				{
					"text": "If we're to build a truly strong bond, we must learn to coexist while also living our separate lives."
				},
				{
					"text": "Now, whether we'll be able to do that will be tested when summer break is over."
				},
				{
					"text": "We spent the last days of August in the same manner."
				},
				{
					"text": "We read, wrote, and lived together in the same space."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "What kind of story is it?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "It's about a middle-aged man who decides he wants to run a marathon. The story is about the little changes you can see in yourself when you put in the effort, and the hope they bring."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "I think it's plain, simple, and doesn't really stand out from the crowd..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "But at least I mustered up the courage and patience to write even a shoddy little piece like this. Took me long enough."
				},
				{
					"text": "I finish that last sentence with a little chuckle."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "If I started sooner, maybe I could've been earning my current salary from writing."
				},
				{

				},
				{

					"text": "I'd love to read it."
				},

				},
				{
					"text": "Then she turns to look at my manuscript."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "I didn't finish mine, but can I read yours?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I nod and present it to her."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "It's such a refreshing story. Perfect for summer."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "It's completely different from the things you're written so far."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Uh, it's kind of hard to put into words, but I suppose I didn't go as hard with this one."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "It just kinda let myself write naturally. It's been a long time since I last had that experience."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "Yeah, I can feel that."
				},
				{

				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",

					"name": "Arishima",

				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "You do?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "The feeling of wanting your loved one to read it..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "And at the same time, the fear of laying yourself bare."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",

				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "For her, that novel is... a pure depiction of her deepest emotions. A story from the heart that tells more about her than a diary ever could."
				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "And she's lost. Wondering if she should show that to the man she loves."

					"text": "Aw, stop it. You're making it sound like we won't see each other ever again."
				},

				},

					"text": "Why am I like this?"

				},
				{
					"text": "I couldn't put my ego aside in front of him."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't want to take away his life."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't want to become a shackle on him."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "His heart healed. He's stronger now."
				},
				{

				},
				{

				{
					"text": "Please, forget about me."

				},
				{
					"text": "I left the house with a little time to spare, still dressed as I had been when I saw the teacher off."
				},
				{
					"text": "I walk through the city after the waves of students heading to school have died down."
				},
				{
					"text": "Over the past summer, I've grown to like this city a little more."
				},
				{
					"text": "The café where I had my first meal with my teacher and the fish shop where he remembered my face are part of this city."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't know why I hadn't noticed it before."
				},
				{
					"text": "It was a nice town, this place."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm glad I finally realized that."
				},
				{
					"text": "The days I spent with my teacher made me realize that I was still a young child."
				},
				{
					"text": "No matter how tall you are."
				},
				{
					"text": "No, the taller she was, the more her infancy seemed to stand out."
				},
				{
					"text": "All of my daily necessities fit into this small carrying case."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wonder if this is the weight of my life to date."
				},
				{
					"text": "With these thoughts in mind, I pulled my light carry-on case and headed for the station."
				},
				{
					"text": "I walked to the end of the platform, which was sparsely populated."
				},
				{
					"text": "Across the railroad tracks and over the fence, I can see the city of Yumemi, where I have lived until today."
				},
				{
					"text": "I stared blankly at the city and the flow of people walking through it."
				},
				{
					"text": "At that moment, I clearly felt that I was no longer a resident of that city."
				},
				{
					"text": "They were people I didn't know, walking in a city where I didn't exist."
				},
				{
					"text": "There is no place for me in this city anymore."
				},
				{
					"text": "It was my choice. I didn't feel lonely."
				},
				{
					"text": "From a distance, I could hear the sound of a train running."
				},
				{
					"text": "It was the sound of a train carrying me and my child to the next city."
				},
				{
					"text": "I put my hand over my stomach."
				},
				{
					"text": "I smile, tears running down my face."
				},
				{
					"text": "My hands are warm."
				},
				{
					"text": "The one thing giving me peace is the child growing inside of me."
				},
				{
					"text": "I..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't want to throw away my life like my father did."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't want to be a parent like that."
				},
				{
					"text": "My parents left me unbearable loneliness and unspent money."
				},
				{
					"text": "Wealth beyond anything I could ever accomplish."
				},
				{
					"text": "Regardless of whether I want it or not, I have to live with it."
				},
				{
					"text": "But I can use it to protect this baby."
				},
				{
					"text": "I made up my mind."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'll raise this baby myself."
				},
				{
					"text": "I feel happy, overcome with a feeling that I can only assume is motherhood enveloping me."
				},
				{
					"text": "It makes me feel like I can become whole."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm not alone anymore."
				},
				{
					"text": "Having something to protect, I find meaning in life for the first time."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yes..."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's thanks to him. He saved me."
				},

				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "...I'll be strong. We'll make it."
				},
				{
					"text": "I mutter to myself, gently stroking my stomach."
				},
				{
					"text": "The train comes into the platform, blocking the view of the city I'm leaving."
				},
				{
					"text": "The doors slide open. I stop for a moment, then shake my head."
				},
				{
					"text": "And then, I step into the train."
