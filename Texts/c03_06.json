				},
				{
					"text": "This was my usual road from home to the academy, but I stuck to it pretty rigidly."
				},
				{
					"text": "As we approach, we notice the trail has little steps made out of small logs and flattened soil."
				},
				{
					"text": "A man-made trail, then."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "There's stairs, even."

				},
				{
					"text": "I've never been here before."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "I didn't think I'd warm up to this place so much. I used to think it was such a backwater."
				},
				{
					"text": "She smiles at me as she speaks."

				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Your shoots are so much fun."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",

				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "I don't care about that."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Ahahah! Now that I think about it, getting to talk with you now, while you're still pure and innocent, might be something really special."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "You can also..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Hm?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "You can make lots of people smile too. You have that kind of power."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Your smile can make people happy..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "...just as well as my photography."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "You think so?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Yeah. Sometimes I take a look at that photo of you to cheer myself up."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Only sometimes?!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "...Actually, it's every single day."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Really?!"
				},
				{
					"text": "I nod."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Oh, you cheeky little thing! You head over heels for me or something?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "...I am."
				},
				{
					"text": "My response obviously takes her by surprise. She stares right at the camera, eyes wide."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "I realized I'm in love with you."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Can you say it one more time?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I lower the camera and look directly at her."
				},
				{
					"text": "She returns my gaze."
				},
				{
					"text": "There's a faint blush in her cheeks."
				},
				{
					"text": "I can tell that my face is red and hot as well."
				},
				{
					"text": "I go back to looking at her through the viewfinder."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yeah, I still can't say it straight to her face..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "I think you know what I said."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Ahahah!"
				},
				{
					"text": "A smile of pure joy spreads across her face."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Sounds like we feel the same way about each other."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "It seems so."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Am I your first love?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Maybe."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Yippee!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "So I'm your first, huh? I'm so glad I did this teacher training thing."
				},
				{
					"text": "Sumomo turns her gaze to the town."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "I'll get better at photography."
				},
				{
					"text": "She turns around to face me again."
				},
				{

					"text": "Yes! I know you will!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "I'll be able to teach you even more about it."
				},
				{

					"text": "Yes!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "So..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "She waits for me to continue."
				},
				{
					"text": "The wind blows, stirring her hair."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Come back and visit me sometime."
				},
				{
					"text": "Sumomo nods."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "I'll come anytime, if you'll be there waiting for me."
				},
				{
					"text": "The tears welling up in my eyes make it difficult to get the image in focus."
				},
				{
					"text": "I want to get a picture of that gentle smile."
				},
				{
					"text": "I know this is no time to be crying."
				},
				{
					"text": "And yet the tears don't stop."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wipe the tears away with my hand."
				},
				{
					"text": "Sumomo just watches, her smile unwavering."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Sorry."
				},
				{
					"text": "She shakes her head slowly."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "It's okay."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Mhm."
				},
				{
					"text": "I take a deep breath and look through the viewfinder again."
				},
				{
					"text": "Now that I've got her in focus, I can see she has tears in her eyes too."
				},
				{
					"text": "But she's still smiling."
				},
				{
					"text": "Both her smile and her tears are so undeniably Sumomo. I press the shutter again."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "You got my good side?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "That's every side."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "That was smooth, heheh."
				},
				{
					"text": "She giggles at my comment."
				},
				{
					"text": "After coming down back down from the hill, we have lunch together."
				},
				{
					"text": "We start looking through the photos on my camera's display, reminiscing about the summer. It feels like we've only just begun when I notice that the sun is setting."
				},
				{
					"text": "Where did all the time go?"
				},
				{
					"text": "We leave the fast food restaurant where we spent way too much time, and head back to the city."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "You've got your homework from your teacher, right? To take pictures of people looking at Halley's Comet?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Yeah. I was thinking about heading to the academy. I hear they opened the roof for comet-watching."
				},
				{
					"text": "There were posters about it in the library."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "The academy, huh? I guess it'd be awkward for me to tag along, since I'm no longer part of the faculty."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "If you have the time, we can go together. It's open to the public, so it's probably okay."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Do you wanna go together?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "After a long silence, I nod."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Ahahah! You've gotten a lot more upfront about what you want."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Then I'll come with. I wanna be with you."
				},
				{
					"text": "There's already a crowd at the academy's entrance."
				},
				{
					"text": "The entrance is wide open, and people are pouring in en masse."
				},
				{
					"text": "There are all kinds of people, from really little kids to adults old enough to be parents of students."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Whoa, that's a lot of people."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "This only comes around once every 76 years, I guess."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Guess this is our comet party, huh?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Yes! This is great!"
				},
				{
					"text": "As we enter, we find the undergraduates who sponsored the get-together guiding visitors to the elevators."
				},
				{
					"text": "Sumomo and I follow the crowds to the rooftop."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Whoa, this place is packed!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "This only happens once every 76 years, so no wonder."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "You're gonna take pics of lots of different people, right? Wanna split off?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Huh? But..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "This is an important job for you. Go take lots of nice photos. It's the first step towards your dream!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "I'll be watching you kill it from the sidelines!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "Okay. I'll do it."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Go for it!"
				},
				{
					"text": "Kanna walks off, fiddling with the huge camera hanging from a strap around his neck."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wonder if a big camera like that is hard to use."
				},
				{
					"text": "Something about him seems stronger than before, more reliable."
				},
				{
					"text": "Or maybe that's just my imagination."
				},
				{
					"text": "I watch him strike up a conversation with a family comet-gazing together."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wonder if he's asking for permission to take photos of them."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yes, good. He'd never take pictures of someone without their consent. That's my boy."
				},
				{
					"text": "He raises his camera and snaps a shot of the smiling family."
				},
				{
					"text": "After taking a few more, he bows and thanks them."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yes, good. It's nice to thank people properly. That's my boy."
				},
				{
					"text": "He glances my way and waves."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Ahahah."
				},
				{
					"text": "The little gesture is so sweet that it makes me laugh."
				},
				{
					"text": "I return the wave, and then he turns away with a smile and moves on to the next person."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Heh... I shouldn't get in his way."
				},
				{
					"text": "Step by step, he's getting closer to his dream."
				},
				{
					"text": "He argued with his dad, then made up."
				},
				{
					"text": "He found a rival and got jealous over their success, and lost his way a few times."
				},
				{
					"text": "But I can feel he's slowly growing up into the person he wants to be."
				},
				{
					"text": "But what about me? What should I do?"
				},
				{
					"text": "If I just while the years away..."
				},
				{
					"text": "He may be disappointed with me when we manage to meet again."
				},
				{
					"text": "I let out a small sigh."
				},
				{
					"text": "And that sigh..."
				},
				{
					"text": "Is matched by one from the girl sitting next to me."
				},
				{
					"text": "When I turn to her, she looks right back at me."
				},
				{
					"name": "Student",
					"text": "Oh?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Hm?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Her eyes are red and swollen."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't think I know her."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'd guess she's around the same age as Kanna."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's been staring at me, her head cocked to the side."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Um..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Student",
					"text": "Miss Mononouchi Sumomo? That's you, right? The teacher?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "How do you know my full name?!"
				},
				{
					"text": "But after saying that, I realize."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Oh, right, you're in the same class as Kanna?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Student",
					"text": "Who's Kanna?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",

				},
				{

					"text": "Yep, I did."
				},
				{
					"text": "She looks back out at the crowd, a lonely smile on her lips."
				},
				{
					"text": "I watch her for a moment."
				},
				{
					"text": "Then, all of a sudden, tears well up in her eyes again."
				},
				{
					"text": "I follow her gaze."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's staring at a couple holding hands."
				},
				{
					"text": "They look to be about the same age as Kanna too."
				},
				{
					"text": "I see. I think I know what's going on here."

				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Boy trouble?"

				{
					"name": "Student",
					"text": "Huh?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "Turning back to me, she starts to cry in earnest."
				},
				{
					"text": "Her eyeliner is smudged, making her look like a little like a panda."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's also used way too much rouge and didn't blend it properly."
				},
				{
					"text": "She must not be used to wearing makeup."
				},
				{
					"text": "Maybe she put it on for the first time because she wanted to look pretty for the boy she likes."
				},
				{
					"text": "Her hair is also in such a state that I'd love to have a word with her hairstylist."
				},
				{
					"text": "She looks like a pretty ordinary girl."
				},
				{
					"text": "She must have really mustered up all her courage for this special day."
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "It's that guy, right?"
				},
				{
					"text": "My eyes are fixed on the couple."
				},
				{
