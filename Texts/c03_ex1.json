				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Azuki",

				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "You gotta be kidding me! How do you only bring bananas on a camping trip?!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Azuki",
					"text": "What else do you need?! Besides, Japanese monkeys eat potatoes, not bananas, you airhead! We don't grow bananas here!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Then you're worse than a monkey!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Azuki",
					"text": "Ah shut up! You're just stupid! Dumb bimbo!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Monkey!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Azuki",
					"text": "Let me tell you about bananas! They don't grow here in Japan, so you gotta breed them specially or import them! They're an achievement of science! Japanese bananas are the best!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "Ahahah! The monkey's defending bananas now!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Azuki",
					"text": "Well you're not getting your hands on a single one of these, you hear me?!"

					"text": "It was a blast!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",
					"text": "But Azuki really needs to get real. I mean, bringing only bananas to camp out?"
				},
				{

				{
					"name": "Azuki",
					"text": "Bananas are all you need, right?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",

				},
				{
					"name": "Azuki",
					"text": "Damn, you got pissy when you became a housewife! Don't eat my bananas! You ought to apologize to the banana god!"
				},

				},
				{
					"name": "Azuki",

				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",

				},
				{
					"name": "Sumomo",

				},
				{
					"name": "Kanna",
					"text": "We haven't been able to go camping lately, now that I think about it. We gotta use Hachimaru more. I mean, Azuki was kind enough to give it back and all."
