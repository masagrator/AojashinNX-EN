					"text": "Memorizing them by rote is a common pitfall. I suggest you get into the habit of inferring their meaning from context through particles and auxiliary verbs."
				},

					"text": "That's what the students want. It's what I want too."

					"text": "Most students that come to the cafeteria do so with friends in tow."

				},
				{

				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "There's a ten minute interval between the first and second warning bells, and I tend to spend them here."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's the only place in the school cut off from the innocence of student life."
				},
				{
					"text": "Like a place with its own rules."
				},
				{

					"text": "Most young teachers will spend most of their lives in a school building."
				},
				{
					"text": "They rarely have a life outside the school community."
				},
				{

				},
				{

				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "I'd say we're the only adults here, deep down."

				{
					"name": "Arishima",

				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "Of course. It's a sign of a versatile mind."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",

				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",

				},
				{

				},
				{

				},
				{

				{

				},
				{

				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "As soon as we step into the air conditioned corridor, a brown-haired girl notices Watanabe and laughs."

				},
				{
					"name": "Watanabe",
					"text": "What, you trying to get me in trouble? I'll be right there."
				},
				{
					"text": "The girl laughs in response to his banter."
				},
				{
					"text": "Watanabe's quick on his feet. I admire him for that."
				},
				{
					"text": "Despite us being in the same situation, he carries himself a lot better than me."
				},
				{
					"text": "Maybe he is the real adult here."
				},
				{
					"text": "I've got quite a few years on him, but I might still be a child, deep down."
				},
				{
					"text": "After the two afternoon periods, I head to the library like usual."
				},
				{
					"text": "I haven't changed since my student days."
				},
				{
					"text": "Scratch that. I have changed."
				},
				{
					"text": "Now I get indigestion from fried foods, and I smoke a pack of cigarettes daily."
				},
				{
					"text": "My body's getting old."
				},
				{
					"text": "But my mind hasn't matured at all."
				},
				{
					"text": "I walk on, continuing to chastise myself."
				},
				{
					"text": "Upon entering the library, I receive a polite nod from a pretty girl. She has short hair held in place with a white headband."
				},
				{
					"text": "I nod back as I gaze at the smile."
				},
				{
					"text": "I can imagine a lot of boys come here just to see her."
				},
				{
					"text": "Such are my idle thoughts as I head for the paperback section."
				},
				{
					"text": "I've always carried one in my back pocket since my student days."
				},
				{
					"text": "These pocket paperbacks are the first thing I think of when I think of books."
				},
				{
					"text": "Only books that go through multiple printings get the pocket paperback treatment."
				},
				{
					"text": "I learned that only after I started writing professionally."
				},
				{
					"text": "In the end, none of my books ended up here."
				},
				{
					"text": "I didn't even manage to snag a rookie award."
				},
				{
					"text": "It was a pipe dream to expect I'd ever see my work in this format."
				},
				{
					"text": "I picked up a lot of anecdotes from the publishing world that didn't actually help me with writing, and after years of making excuses, I just stopped trying."
				},
				{
					"text": "I start skimming the title and author names on the spines."
				},
				{
					"text": "My eyes stop on the name of a certain author."
				},
				{
					"text": "I reach for the book."
				},
				{
					"text": "Hatano Shuho."
				},
				{
					"text": "An extremely popular domestic writer who passed away before making it to forty years old."
				},
				{
					"text": "They still air a TV documentary about him once a year."
				},
				{
					"text": "Sometimes he wrote love stories with effortless prose, and other times he wrote more esoteric pieces that couldn't be categorized neatly by genre."
				},
				{
					"text": "But no matter what he wrote, it always sold."
				},
				{
					"text": "Bookstores would set up a special section for every new release, and they'd always be packed with loyal readers."
				},
				{
					"text": "Since he was unusually approachable for a writer, he often appeared on variety shows."
				},
				{
					"text": "His popularity and skill were both unmatched."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's hard to believe we attended the same seminars."
				},
				{
					"text": "When I saw him publish his debut work while in school, I realized it'd be impossible for me to make a living as a writer."
				},
				{
					"text": "Still, I lied to myself and tried it for a while. It didn't last long."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's been... years since I last read a book of his."
				},
				{
					"text": "But..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I remember my plans for tonight."
				},
				{
					"text": "The memorial service for a college teacher of mine."
				},
				{
					"text": "I heard about it last night."
				},
				{
					"text": "It brought memories of my college days back for the first time in a while."
				},
				{
					"text": "With Shuho's book in hand, I gaze at the other books on the shelf."
				},
				{
					"text": "There are empty slots there from where volumes in his serial works have been rented out."
				},
				{
					"text": "Even now, he's finding new readers at this school."
				},
				{
					"text": "Even in death he casts a long shadow, reminding me of my sheer inferiority."
				},
				{
					"text": "After all, failed writers like me are a dime a dozen."
				},
				{
					"text": "Many literature teachers wanted to be writers themselves at some time."
				},
				{
					"text": "My story is a common one."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm like an extra in someone else's film, no matter where I go."
				},
				{
					"text": "It was only in recent years that I gave up the illusion and accepted my lot in life."
				},
				{
					"text": "I grab a two-volume set and take a seat at a table next to a window."
				},
				{
					"text": "When I sit down, I catch a flash of white out of the corner of my eye."
				},
				{
					"text": "I look up and follow it."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's a girl, her white hair tied at the nape of her neck."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's the one I saw in the cafeteria."
				},
				{
					"text": "She stops and pulls out a seat."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's also holding a Hatano Shuho novel."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's the same story I chose, but it's the hardcover version."
				},
				{
					"text": "I move my gaze to her face."
				},
				{
					"text": "Her deep red eyes stare back into mine."
				},
				{
					"text": "I quickly turn away to face my table."
				},
				{
					"text": "I hear her sit behind me as I focus on my book."
				},
				{
					"text": "When the sun starts setting, the bell rings again."
				},
				{
					"text": "The days get so long in June."
				},
				{
					"text": "I close my book and stand up."
				},
				{
					"text": "As I do, my eyes sweep by the place the girl had been sitting."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's not there anymore."
				},
				{
					"text": "I sigh."
				},
				{
					"text": "Was it a sigh of disappointment, or relief?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I couldn't really say."
				},
				{
					"text": "I hit up the station closest to the academy and take it two stops down."
				},
				{
					"text": "I change trains there, then go one more stop."
				},
				{
					"text": "From there, it's a fifteen minute walk to the residential area where my house is."
				},
				{
					"text": "As I walk, my cell phone rings."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's a message from my wife."
				},
				{
					"text": "I respond and then stow the phone back in my pocket."
				},
				{
					"text": "...Deceased at sixty-eight years old."
				},
				{
					"text": "A little young to say he lived a full life."
				},
				{
					"text": "I hear he had heart failure."
				},
				{
					"text": "I stare absently at the crimson sunset."
				},
				{
					"text": "I was twenty-three then."
				},
				{
					"text": "I was in college."
				},
				{
					"text": "It was in Yamada's seminar that I met my wife and witnessed the genius of Hatano Shuho firsthand."
				},
				{
					"text": "A truly electric time, compared to the life I lead now."
				},
				{
					"text": "Is that the nature of youth?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I used to talk writing with my wife from morning to night, but now we barely speak."
				},
				{
					"text": "Hatano Shuho's death turned him into a mythological figure. Even now, readers seek out the worlds he created."
				},
				{
					"text": "Meanwhile, I'm going to walk a quiet road to old age, then to the grave."
				},
				{
					"text": "I've met thousands of students in my career."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yet I haven't made an impression with any of them."
				},
				{
					"text": "I probably won't leave a single mark on this world when I die."
				},
				{
					"text": "At the ceremony are seminar graduates like me, and people young enough to be current students as well."
				},
				{
					"text": "He must have been working at the university until just before his death."
				},
				{
					"text": "There's also a woman with eyes raw from crying."
				},
				{
					"text": "I offer her my gift, light a stick of incense for the deceased, then make my way out."
				},
				{
					"text": "The entrance is crowded with attendants in mourning dress going their separate ways."
				},
				{
					"text": "Among them, a familiar figure draws my eyes."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's that girl."
				},
				{
					"text": "The white-haired girl who always eats alone in the cafeteria, who was reading the Hatano Shuho novel in the library today."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's looking at me."
				},
				{
					"text": "No, maybe she's just looking in my general direction. I'm not the only person here."
				},
				{
					"text": "What is she doing here?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I find myself gazing into her deep red eyes."
				},
				{

					"text": "Ah, sorry."

				},
				{

					"text": "Gentle droplets patter on the asphalt, leaving small dark stains here and there."

				{
					"text": "First, I open it to the page where my piece starts."
				},
				{
					"text": "My work describes Meiji-Dori in winter, from the perspective of a single ginkgo tree standing beside the bustling city road."
				},
				{
					"text": "As I keep reading, I remember more and more of what I was thinking at the time."
				},
				{
					"text": "I tried to depict the drama of the various characters who pass by, and how the tree adds color to the street and life to the background of the myriad little stories that occur in everyday life. But I failed."
				},
				{
					"text": "The professor told me that the idea wasn't a bad one, but the themes were too sprawling for the limited number of pages I had to work with."
				},
				{
					"text": "In my youthful excess, I tried to write something bigger than everyone else."
				},
				{
					"text": "There are also some pretentious metaphors in it that make me cringe in embarrassment."
				},
				{
					"text": "But Watanabe was right; the passage of time really reminds me that the person who wrote this back then isn't the person I am today."
				},
				{
					"text": "And then, there's Hatano Shuho's contribution."
				},
				{
					"text": "He wrote a first person narrative about how he skipped a lecture one day to make a round trip from Takadanobaba to Sakuragicho."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's a concise and short work that describes the shifting scenery in a very matter-of-fact manner."
				},
				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Sakuragicho..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I look up from the book."

					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Somewhere in Yokohama, huh?"
				},
				{
					"text": "The location of that nighttime view on his book's cover."
				},
				{
					"text": "Maybe Sakuragicho was already a special spot for him by this point."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wonder if Rin knows about this."
				},
				{
					"text": "Maybe she'll be able to glean something from what he wrote back when he was a simple college student."
				},
				{
					"text": "I look down at his prose again."
				},
				{
					"text": "Although he's not writing about himself or his ego in this piece, I can feel something true in it."
				},
				{
					"text": "Reading the text he wrote, for the first time, I feel like I could reach out and touch the scenery he's trying to evoke."
				},
				{
					"text": "In comparison, my writing was rough, stilted, and shoddy."
				},
				{
					"text": "I feel like I could write something better now."
				},
				{
					"text": "But that faint flicker of hope is quickly dashed."
				},
				{
					"text": "There is no talent in me. There never was."
				},
				{
					"text": "At this point, Shuho had already found his way of writing."
				},
				{
					"text": "Even if it's a little unrefined at this point."
				},
				{
					"text": "Compared to his debut novel, it feels like he's still feeling it out to find a style that fits him best."
				},
				{
					"text": "I close the anthology."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't think I'll read it anymore."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'll give it to Rin as soon as possible."

				{
					"text": "The next day after classes, I find Rin is already in the library before me."
				},
				{
					"text": "I sit in front of her."

				{
					"text": "She closes the novel she's reading and puts it on the desk."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's another book by her dad."
				},
				{
					"text": "I hand over the anthology and photo album to her."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "What is this?"

				{
					"name": "Arishima",

					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "Can I look inside?"

				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "Go ahead."

				{
					"text": "She flips through the pages with a little smile on her face."
				},
				{
					"text": "I watch her."
				},
				{
					"text": "After a few pages, she looks back at me."
				},
				{
					"text": "Her rose eyes have a faint glimmer to them."
				},
				{
					"text": "Then, again, she turns that bright gaze back to the album."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's looking at the picture of me and my wife."

				{
					"name": "Rin",
					"text": "A girlfriend?"

				{
					"name": "Arishima",
					"text": "...Wife."
