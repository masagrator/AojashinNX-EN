				},

				},
				{
					"text": "Somehow, I feel like the moment that bird fell was when she breathed for the last time."
				},
				{
					"text": "From the view of that bird flying high, the city must have looked like one single, uninterrupted space connected to the sky."
				},
				{
					"text": "Low side, middle side, top side..."

					"text": "With tears still pouring down our faces, we watch it go."
				},
				{
					"text": "But before long, the little bird becomes nothing but a dot that then disappears behind the clouds."
				},
				{
					"text": "A simple hole in the bare earth wall of the low side."
				},
				{
					"text": "That's all we lowsiders get for a grave."
				},
				{
					"text": "Graves we might call them, but they're not much more than small holes in the dirt that we then cover the bodies of the deceased. And now, Mommy's in one of those."

				},
				{

				{
					"text": "The nice old man that assigns us work was there too."

					"text": "We both followed as they took Mommy away."
				},
				{
					"text": "The encyclopedia I read listed several types of funerals they did back on the surface."
				},
				{
					"text": "People long ago burned the dead out of fear they would come back to life, or buried them in weird positions, or left stones above their graves to keep them from getting up."
				},
				{
					"text": "Maybe having a huge sky over their heads made their imaginations run wild."
				},
				{
					"text": "Down here, we know it's just a corpse. It won't come back to life."
				},
				{
					"text": "So we wrap them in a cloth, and then bury them deep inside a hole in the clay walls surrounding this side."
				},
				{
					"text": "There's a lot of soil for that here in the low side."
				},
				{
					"text": "The adults bury Mommy's body deep down in the earth."
