				},

				},
				{
					"text": "Before being dumped like trash, Izumo had her data wiped and some of her functions disabled."

				{
					"text": "It seems like the topsiders don't like their androids being reused, so they intentionally ruin their functionality before throwing them away."
				},
				{
					"text": "It took a long time to repair the damage they had done to her."
				},
				{
					"text": "I still haven't managed to fix her completely, either."
				},
				{
					"text": "The fact that she cooks the exact same thing every day must mean there are still some things not quite sorted out inside of her."
				},

				{

					"text": "There's only room for one table in our tiny house."
				},
				{
					"text": "At each mealtime, I have to shelve my terminals and research materials, then get them back out after we're done."
				},
				{
					"text": "I've always wanted the space for at least one more desk."
				},
				{
					"text": "Moving to the middle side would solve all that."
				},
				{
					"text": "Just the thought of it makes my heart leap."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yonagi places several books on the table along with a hardcover notebook and a pen, and sits across from me."
				},
				{
					"text": "Every night she writes her stories down in that thick notebook."
				},
				{
					"text": "I believe she's writing a story about William Shakespeare right now."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's always liked his stories, ever since we were kids."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's hard to believe that even after humanity fled underground, we're still reading something some Western guy wrote eight centuries ago."
				},
				{
					"text": "I doubt Shakespeare himself could have even imagined such a thing back in his time."
				},
				{
					"text": "After dinner, we each do our own thing until bedtime."
				},
				{
					"text": "I continue my research while Yonagi reads and writes."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's a quiet, joyful time."
				},
				{
					"text": "There's nothing better than spending our time together in the same space as we work on our own different projects."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's a habit we fell into soon after we started living together."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "I wonder what kind of person he was..."
				},
				{
					"text": "About a hour and a half into her reading, Yonagi murmurs to herself, seemingly in deep thought."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Shakespeare?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Yeah."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Good question."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "I imagine he was popular with the ladies."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "What makes you say that?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "He captures the woman's heart so well! It's kind of, like, poethic!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Poethic."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "He writes about so many different things. It's honestly kind of intimidating."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Really? How so?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "It feels almost like one human couldn't possibly have written this. Like it has to be the work of many people or something."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Maybe he just had a good memory like me."
				},
				{
					"text": "There's an unnatural silence after that. I look up from my research."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Oh, I see! So he was able to write about so many things because he remembered the stories of the people in his life so well?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Uh, it's not like I knew the guy."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "No one does. The records of his time are pretty vague. Though that does have its upsides."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Really?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Yonagi nods and raises a finger to her chin."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "What do you mean?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "It gives me some creative freedom to... embellish the details a little. Or a lot."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I see. So if you were to seriously argue that Galileo Galilei or Isaac Newton were actually women, nobody could tell you that you were wrong."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Maybe so!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "That does sound like an interesting story."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "So if Shakespeare was the kind of guy who never forgets a story once he hears it..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Then wouldn't he need to be in a position where he talks with lots of different people?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "So like a teacher or something?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "That would probably be too limiting."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Professors may talk to many people, but they're usually younger, and the age range is limited."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "It sounds like I need to do some research on old England."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "That sounds like a plan."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "You're starting work at the institute tomorrow, right? Maybe I can swing by the library when I'm done with work tomorrow. It's been a while since I last visited."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Sounds good. Let's meet up there."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Yeah! We haven't been to the library together in forever."
				},
				{
					"text": "She turns back to the book in her hand, looking pleased."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "...Wanna do it today?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Mhm."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Okay."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yonagi closes the book and holds out her hand."
				},
				{
					"text": "Mom's looking out the window."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's her."
				},
				{
					"text": "I try calling out, but sadly..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "No sound comes out of my mouth."
				},
				{
					"text": "She just keeps looking out the window."
				},
				{
					"text": "Her chest slowly moves up and down in time with her breathing."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "No luck?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I shake my head."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Hmm..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "No dice, huh?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Yonagi has the power to conjure up and share images with others."
				},
				{
					"text": "I started calling the world she creates the \"dreamscape.\""
				},
				{
					"text": "Mom started appearing in it shortly after we started living together."
				},
				{
					"text": "I believe it might have something to do with the first time when Yonagi and I shared strong emotions."
				},
				{
					"text": "It was the first time anyone else had appeared in her dreamscape."
				},
				{
					"text": "Before that, all she could show was her own memories and the characters she'd created."
				},
				{
					"text": "But..."
				},
				{
					"text": "Despite my mom being right there, we can't communicate."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm merely a spectator in the space Yonagi creates."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm still searching for a way to actually interact with her dreamscape."
				},
				{
					"text": "I feel frustration at being unable to reach out to Mom when she's right in front of me."
				},
				{
					"text": "But it only serves to fuel my desire to study and find a solution."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Izumo, could you show our brain waves?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Izumo",
					"text": "I will begin monitoring them."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I compare our brain waves after entering the dreamscape."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "How can we make it so you can talk in there?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I really don't know. It's not like there are any precedents for this."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "And I don't have the power to project mental images like you do."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Mhm, mhm."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I think if we're able to reproduce a faux dreamscape, and maybe convey my thoughts to you in real time, it could work."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Right now, my perception of myself talking isn't being received by your mind at all."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I think that's why I can't interact with your dreamscape."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "The communication only goes one way."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Hmm. So what do we do?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Synchronize something we both have."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Like our brainwaves, maybe. For example, when you have a fun conversation with someone close to you, the frequency and amplitude of your brainwaves start to synchronize."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Whoa!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "But I still don't have any way to transmit them to you..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Man, this whole science thing sure is tough, huh?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Okay!"
				},
				{
					"text": "I pack my stuff into the bag I've been using since I was a kid, and hang it over my shoulder."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I'm ready."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "Right! I'll come to the institute after I'm done with work, okay?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I nod in response."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Have a good day."
				},
				{
					"name": "Yonagi",
					"text": "I'll try! Do your best, my junior researcher!"
				},
				{
					"text": "She sees me off with a bashful smile on her face."
				},
				{
					"text": "She does this every morning, without fail."
				},
				{
					"text": "And I remember each and every one of her smiles."
				},
				{
					"text": "It wasn't until I started living with Yonagi that my inability to forget things began to seem like not such a bad thing after all."
				},
				{
					"text": "I go up the elevator to the middle side and head to the institute."
				},
				{
					"text": "I find myself staring at the researchers' living quarters located behind the main building."
				},
				{
					"text": "Anyone who becomes a full researcher gets to live there, and can commute to work in just minutes."
				},
				{
					"text": "My pace slows as I imagine myself walking to work from one of those buildings."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wouldn't have to clean dirt off my shoes every day."
				},
				{
					"text": "No more worrying about the cornfield sprinkler schedule whenever we want to go out."
				},
				{
					"text": "I could give Yonagi a better life. We could be together in one of those big houses."
				},
				{
					"text": "As I daydream, I notice a familiar face walking along from the living area to the square."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Good morning."
				},
				{
					"name": "Iruma",
					"text": "And so we meet on the very first day of our new life as researchers. I can't help but wonder if it's fate that's brought us together this fine morning."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Maybe it has to do with the fact we're both going to the same place."
				},
				{
					"text": "He catches up to me and we walk together to the institute."
				},
				{
					"text": "I first met Iruma in an engineering course for research candidates."
				},
				{
					"text": "He's a born midsider and his father is a researcher as well. He's always been pretty friendly, though."
				},
				{
					"text": "While all the other midsider research candidates held me in clear contempt for being a lowsider, Iruma was the only one to speak to me like a human being."
				},
				{
					"text": "I remember one of the first things he said to me after I explained my situation: \"Whoa, how did you manage to study with all the work you lowsiders have to do? You must be a genius.\""
				},
				{
					"text": "It was kind of a rude thing to say, but I could tell he wasn't trying to be mean at all."
				},
				{
					"text": "He wasn't trying to make fun of me for being a lowsider. He was genuinely impressed by the fact that I'd managed to accomplish something in such difficult circumstances."
				},
				{
					"text": "Ever since then, heâ€™s been the only person I could call my friend in the workplace."
				},
				{
					"name": "Iruma",

				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",

				},
				{
					"text": "I heard that the lab Iruma applied for got the most applications this year."
				},
				{
					"text": "That'd be Kano lab. They're at the forefront of the study of drugs that can improve UV ray resistance, and that's the subject of research that's more predominant in the institute right now."

				{
					"name": "Iruma",
					"text": "What's Professor Asuma researching, even?"

				{
					"name": "Iruma",
					"text": "Oh, I remember that. I didn't know there were labs still looking into that."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "It's just him. That's why I didn't have much choice."
				},
				{
					"name": "Iruma",
					"text": "So you care about what you research, huh? I guess when you're valedictorian you start to care about that stuff."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "You don't care about what you work on?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Iruma",
					"text": "You know I'm just killing time with this whole thing. I just picked the one that would let me socialize with other people the most. It has a lot of people working on it."

				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Heh, always the same, aren't you?"
				},
				{
					"text": "The walls and floors are all white and uniform."
