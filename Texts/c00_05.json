				},
				{
					"text": "A smile playing about his face, he nods."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "So the blueprint you're using to make up the world in this emulator exists only in your brain. Ah, but perhaps calling it a cyanotype would be more apt. You are, after all, reproducing your mental images onto a new sheet."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "While he prepares the coffee, I tell him about the information I've gathered and what I know of the emulator."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "I see, so you stripped out the functions of a regular emulator and made it into a device that can measure bio signals."
				},

					"text": "I've been at it every day for the past month."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "We could produce staggering results with this approach. Imagine optimizing the processing of sensory data based on even more data."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "You could produce something usable on a larger scale in months. With this kind of thing, about eighty percent of the time is spent on optimizing the final few things to perfection."
				},
				{
					"text": "I nod along as he speaks."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "I would gladly help if you will allow me to. If you leave this application here, you can make use of the brain waves I produce while in it."

					"text": "Yes, I'll make a backup. I'd be eternally grateful for the help."
				},
				{
					"text": "The professor smiles and seems to ponder something for a moment in front of the coffee machine."
				},
				{

					"text": "So the way the world reacts depends on who is in the virtual space and what they're doing in it..."
				},

				},
				{
					"text": "There were descriptions of it in the medical books I read as a kid."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "It's the system that determines which events the brain registers."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Yes. It means that we're not necessarily aware of everything that happens in front of us. We are aware only of what our mind deems necessary based on our past memories."
				},
				{

					"text": "Like when you are looking to get a new pair of shoes, you unconsciously find yourself fixating on other people's shoes."

					"text": "Our awareness is linked to our memories, and it's always shifting."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "I nod in agreement."
				},

				},
				{

				{
					"text": "These tiny things can improve and maintain one's cells."
				},
				{
					"text": "According to the print on the sheet, they're designed to improve and strengthen the cells of the digestive organs like the stomach and intestines."
				},
				{
					"text": "It appears I must take them continuously and follow the instructions on my personal medical terminal, which is linked to the biometric chip that monitors my health."
				},

				{
					"text": "I had everything I ever wanted."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "I'm unable to forget her expression, her pained tone, and the tears I made her shed."
				},
				{
					"text": "Am I in the wrong?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I didn't even know she used to be a midsider."
				},
				{
					"text": "She never spoke of her family."
				},
				{
					"text": "It never seemed like she thought of anyone but my mom as her mother."
				},
				{
					"text": "I only knew that her father named her, and not much more."
				},
				{
					"text": "I always imagined there was something going on there, since she never spoke of him."
				},
				{
					"text": "I knew both her parents passed away, but I didn't know anything about their lives."
				},
				{
					"text": "At least one of them had to have worked in the middle side."

				{
					"text": "A middle side job..."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "The more time goes by, the more unanswered questions I have."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't think I can surmise anything with so little info. She kept her secrets well."
				},
				{
					"text": "When morning comes around, I brew myself some coffee."
				},
				{
					"text": "But strangely enough, the bitter taste does nothing to lift the thick haze that's settled over my mind."
				},
				{
					"text": "I better try to work and distract myself."
				},
				{
					"text": "I go into the dreamscape emulator and record my brain waves."
				},
				{
					"text": "I feel like I'll lose my mind if I just sit here doing nothing."
				},
				{
					"text": "I vacantly stare at the terminal and choose one of the places from the list for the emulator to rebuild."

				},
				{
					"text": "I recall my discussion about the RAS with the professor."
				},
				{
					"text": "Perhaps the images being conjured up by my brain are what it deems I need to see."
				},
				{
					"text": "That's fine."
				},
				{
					"text": "It doesn't matter whether this is reality or not; what does is that I need this space right now."

					"text": "She doesn't stir."
				},
				{
					"text": "She merely keeps looking out the window."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I studied hard and became a researcher, and a midsider. They gave me a house in the middle side, Mom."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm not the same boy I was when I refused to go to school."
				},
				{
					"text": "The coward that couldn't talk back to Shachi."
				},
				{
					"text": "This is the man I wanted Mom to see, so she could be proud of her son."

					"text": "And yet..."

				},
				{
					"text": "We can't keep living in our memories of the past."
				},
				{
					"text": "There's nothing I love more than feeling near to Mom, like I do right now."
				},
				{
					"text": "This is important to me."
				},
				{
					"text": "But we can't live here, can we, Yonagi?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Why can't you understand that?"
				},
				{
					"text": "We're not the only ones being exploited."
				},
				{
					"text": "I just worked my ass off to get through a door that was open to all."
				},
				{
					"text": "Why can't you be happy with what I've achieved for us?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Mom keeps on looking out the window."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "The decisive difference between this and Yonagi's dreamscape..."
				},
				{
					"text": "Is the fact that I could easily communicate with Mom in her dreamscape. Our joint mental images embodied her, made her more than any one of us could conjure on their own."
				},
				{
					"text": "The emulator can't do that."
				},
				{
					"text": "In her dreamscape, Yonagi's the creator, and she can embody whatever she sets her mind to; but there's no such central figure at the heart of this emulator."
				},
				{
					"text": "If any one individual ego takes over and shapes the image of this world, it all falls to chaos."
				},
				{
					"text": "But what if multiple participants were to envision the same image at the same time?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Would it be able to embody something in this space? Would there be a need?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm not trying to recreate the actual surface perfectly."
				},
				{
					"text": "The only thing it needs to do..."
				},
				{
					"text": "...is provide a respite for the people. A place where everyone can calmly await their awakening."
				},
				{
					"text": "Ensuring their comfort must be prioritized over whatever reality is supposed to be."
				},
				{
					"text": "Mom's pale shadow is here right now because the master data of this space consists of me and Yonagi."
				},
				{
					"text": "When the amount of data surpasses us and the simulation becomes large enough to simulate the surface, the image we worked so hard to envision will no longer be realized."
				},
				{
					"text": "If a small number of intense images were embodied through strong emotions of people, it would become like paranormal phenomena popping in and out of existence."
				},
				{
					"text": "But what if it was an image that many longed for? An idol people used to support themselves?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Could such an existence be embodied in this space?"
				},
				{
					"text": "When many participants enter this space and it starts fulfilling its role, adjusting the parameters of this aspect of it would be almost impossible."
				},
				{
					"text": "This function of the simulation would make God manifest, so to speak."
				},
				{
					"text": "When many participants share the same image, that target would be embodied in this space."
				},
				{
					"text": "In reality, the brain usually performs a process in which it compares a predicted map created from past memories with actual sensory signals."
				},
				{
					"text": "Perhaps there will be a need to upload data from the participant's brains to some extent."
				},
				{
					"text": "But as long as the participants can project their own perceived image of the world to contrast it with the base we made, the God manifestation phenomenon can occur."
				},
				{
					"text": "All I can do right now is improve the accuracy of the emulator."
				},
				{
					"text": "I continue my work in silence."
				},
				{
					"text": "By the time the sun begins to set, I assume that the professor won't be showing up."
				},
				{
					"text": "He said he would be teaching the children today."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm sure he's still imparting all those lessons he once gave to me and Yonagi."
				},
				{
					"text": "There may be a kid among those classes who grows up dreaming about becoming part of his lab, like I did."
				},
				{
					"text": "I stop by the square on my way home."
				},
				{
					"text": "The ration line is gone by now."
				},
				{
					"text": "Yonagi's probably back home in the lower side."
				},
				{
					"text": "I sit on a nearby bench and stay there for a while, staring at the faces of the people passing by."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's so strange."
				},
				{
					"text": "All of the lowsiders gathering here and there..."
				},
				{
					"text": "They all look happier than I've ever been since I became a midsider."
				},
				{
					"text": "I watch as they end their day of labor."
				},
				{
					"text": "The hustle and bustle of the middle square sounds to me like it's coming from a whole other world; a world I'm insulated from."
				},
				{
					"text": "They all hold their silver bowls with such care."
				},
				{
					"text": "Must be their rations."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm sure I have about as much food as them, if not more, in my fridge."
				},
				{
					"text": "Did Yonagi go back home carrying her rations in the old pot again?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Will Izumo make her porridge today?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I bring a hand to my cheek and touch it idly."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's the same one Yonagi slapped."
				},
				{
					"text": "As I touch it, a question pops into my mind."
				},
				{
					"text": "Why am I dragging my feet? Why is it so hard to go back home?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't have to take that awful elevator anymore."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't have to wait in line for food anymore."
				},
				{
					"text": "And I don't have to go perform maintenance in the power generation or factory areas like the rest of the adults."
				},
				{
					"text": "I just sit there, watching the lowsiders go about their lives."
				},
				{
					"text": "That's not my place anymore."
				},
				{
					"text": "I chose not to be one of them."
				},
				{
					"text": "The house I abandoned Yonagi for is right there. All mine."
				},
				{
					"text": "...Time to go back."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's no use sulking here."
				},
				{
					"text": "I blow out a sigh and get to my feet."
				},
				{
					"text": "I come back to an empty house."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's really quiet in here."
				},
				{
					"text": "I sit at the table."
				},
				{
					"text": "I don't even have an appetite."
				},
				{
					"text": "At least, I'm not hungry enough to cook for myself."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'd rather keep working in the lab if this is what's waiting for me back home."
				},
				{
					"text": "I worked less efficiently when I was in the lower side."
				},
				{
					"text": "The commute home was horrible, for example."
				},
				{
					"text": "I had to move my tools anytime we needed the table for dinner."
				},
				{
					"text": "I thought I could spend more time researching if I didn't have any of those things eating into my time."
				},
				{
					"text": "How's that working out for you now, Kaito?"
				},
				{
					"text": "Man, my body feels like a piece of lead. Heavier than it ever did after any of my commutes."
				},
				{
					"text": "There are so many things I want to think about and solve, but I can't seem to force myself to move."
				},
				{
					"text": "Is Yonagi having dinner alone, I wonder?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I suppose the day that Yonagi and I start a life together here..."
				},
				{
					"text": "Perhaps there's no such thing anymore..."
