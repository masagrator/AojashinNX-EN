				},
				{
					"text": "It takes me back to the play we performed in secret for Queen Elizabeth, Romeo and Juliet."
				},
				{
					"text": "That's the play that got us the position of Lord Chamberlain's Men in the first place."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wrote only tragedies for a while after that, so this time I wrote a comedy."
				},
				{
					"text": "After the play, I go out and greet our expectant audience, and the theater breaks out in an ovation."
				},
				{
					"text": "A play is complete only when it finally elicits a reaction from the audience."
				},
				{
					"text": "Their cheers fill the theater, guiding our production, and giving the actors on stage confidence."
				},
				{
					"text": "Thus the performance improves, and the audience grows more and more engrossed in our stories."
				},
				{
					"text": "What kickstarts that cycle is the script at the base of it all."
				},
				{
					"text": "There are times when a good script can make up for a lacking execution and performance, but there's no such thing as a good play without a good script."
				},
				{
					"text": "Once there is a script, it is the job of the playwright to keep the whole troupe within the bounds of the story."
				},
				{
					"text": "I've done this professionally for a while now, but premieres are one thing I'll never get used to."

				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "And she's in charge of the rehearsals and the logistics of it all."
				},
				{
					"text": "She's also the one who whips us all into shape."
				},
				{
					"text": "While she may not be on the stage anymore, she is still the leader of this troupe behind the curtains."
				},
				{
					"text": "It is not what we desired, but for now she's content being our shadow leader."

				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",
					"text": "No one who is actually of great importance would ever refer to themselves as such. How suspicious."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kiki",
					"text": "I thought the same, but they just won't go away. They said my whole family would be beheaded unless I bring the people in charge to them."
				},

				},
				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "Wanna go see what this is all about?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Olivia",

				},
				{
					"name": "Will",

				},
				{
					"name": "Queen Elizabeth",
					"text": "I grow restless if I'm not sat on my throne, so I secretly had it brought here to this theater of yours."

				{
					"name": "Will",
					"text": "I didn't even notice..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Queen Elizabeth",

				},
				{

					"text": "Th-That's remarkable!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Queen Elizabeth",
