				{
					"name": "Mom",

				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "Outside the window, all you can see is the cornfields, and past that, the earth wall on the opposite side."
				},
				{
					"text": "All around us are more people living in their small clay houses like us."
				},
				{
					"text": "I get some corn flour from the cupboard and mix it with water."
				},
				{
					"text": "I knead it, make it round, and smash it flat."
				},

					"text": "Then I oil up the flat pan and arrange the dough on top of it."

				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "The wind may be blowing on the surface."
				},
				{
					"text": "The clouds move because of the wind."
				},
				{
					"text": "A lot of songs from when people lived up there long ago talk about the wind."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm sure it must have had some kind of meaning for people back then."

				{
					"text": "Below that, the middle side."
				},
				{
					"text": "Then I turn my eyes straight ahead of me."
				},
				{
					"text": "I can hear my footsteps on the ground."
				},
				{
					"text": "Wind blows underground sometimes, but it's just the flow of air coming from the tunnels connecting to the next town."
				},
				{
					"text": "There are no gently rolling clouds here."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's just cold air moving around."
				},
				{
					"text": "I wonder what it's like."
				},
				{
					"text": "The feel of the wind on your face."
				},
				{

				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "We..."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "When I get up to the middle side, I go to see what work I've been assigned."
				},
				{
					"text": "I get sent to help clean the eastern common area again today."
				},
				{
					"text": "I take a broom and a dustpan then head to my assigned spot."
				},
				{
					"text": "I look up at the monitor in the common area as I sweep the floor."
				},
				{
					"text": "It displays the intensity of the UV rays on the surface."
				},
				{
					"text": "The meter's up to the red part of the bar that means it's in the danger zone."
				},
				{
					"text": "I've never seen it go down below the danger zone."
				},
				{
					"text": "That's why we live underground."
				},
				{
					"text": "On the top of the same screen is a bar that shows how much of the day's water ration has been consumed."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's still morning, and it's already over 70\\%."
				},
				{
					"text": "Today is going to be another day where there isn't any water left by nightfall."
				},
				{
					"text": "And then, the screen switches to an image of the surface."
				},
				{
					"text": "Something red is moving along the brown earth."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Ah..."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's a car."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's a video of a car."
				},
				{
					"text": "I stop to stare at the video."
				},
				{
					"text": "The wheels are turning really fast."
				},
				{
					"text": "How do you make something move that fast?"
				},
				{
					"text": "And what are those shiny parts made of?"
				},
				{
					"text": "The scenery speeds by at a dizzying pace."
				},
				{
					"text": "I've never seen something move that fast."
				},
				{

					"text": "Ouch!"
				},
				{
					"name": "????",
					"text": "Stop daydreaming and get cleaning."
				},
				{
					"text": "Someone hits me on the back of the head."
				},
				{
					"text": "I turn around to see a familiar pair."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's Shachi and his android."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "...Sorry."
				},
				{
					"text": "I turn my back on them and continue sweeping the stone floor."
				},
				{
					"text": "But as soon as I do, he smacks the back of my head again."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I'm working like I'm supposed to now. Why did you hit me?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Shachi",
					"text": "Punishment for your stupid mom slacking off. She's getting rations without working, isn't she?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "She's not slacking off... She can't move."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "She got her exemption and everything."
				},
				{
					"name": "Shachi",
					"text": "Yeah, right. She's just pretending. That's why you're such a lazy idiot. Like mother, like son."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "No."
				},
				{
					"text": "The angrier I feel, the quieter my voice gets."
				},
				{
					"name": "Shachi",
					"text": "Says the boy skipping school."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "No..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Shachi",
					"text": "No what?! Huh?!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"name": "Shachi",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I realize I've stopped sweeping again and quickly resume my work."
				},
				{
					"name": "Shachi",
					"text": "Hmph. Lame."
				},
				{
					"name": "Shachi",
					"text": "Shame I gotta go to school. I sure I wish I was born to a family of slackers that let me do whatever I want."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "..."
				},
				{
					"text": "With that last remark, he leaves."
				},
				{
					"text": "I hear his footsteps growing distant."
				},
				{
					"name": "Shachi",
					"text": "Hey, Izumo! Stop standing around!"
				},
				{
					"text": "I can hear his voice, a good distance away now."
				},
				{
					"text": "And after that, I hear the sound of Izumo's footsteps as she walks away."
				},
				{
					"text": "I turn around and see her following Shachi."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Mommy isn't slacking off..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I mutter, my heart heavy with frustration."
				},
				{
					"text": "But nobody hears me, and saying it doesn't make me feel any better."
				},
				{
					"text": "I finish my morning shift, and then eat the rations I'm given for lunch while still standing up."
				},
				{
					"text": "We often get boiled, mushy cornflakes."
				},
				{
					"text": "I finish eating and go check in for the afternoon shift."
				},
				{
					"text": "By this time, the downsider kids who have finished school are arriving at work as well."
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm the only kid that's been working since the morning."
				},
				{
					"text": "Our family isn't eating for free."
				},
				{
					"text": "I do the work of two people."
				},
				{
					"text": "That's why I go home with rations for both me and mommy."
				},
				{
					"text": "The afternoon work I get assigned is the maintenance of the shared monitors."
				},
				{
					"text": "We work together with adults when it's complicated work like that."
				},
				{
					"text": "They replace some parts that were starting to wear down."
				},
				{
					"text": "After cleaning up, we're tasked with collecting the garbage in bags and taking it down to the lower layer."
				},
				{
					"text": "That's where the trash dump is."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Ah..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I notice some trash that wasn't here yesterday."
				},
				{
					"text": "I dump my bag and start hunting around."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "What is this?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I find a stick-shaped thing connected to a switch. When I press it, the stick vibrates a whole lot."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Huh?"
				},
				{
					"text": "A small brush thing is lying nearby."
				},
				{
					"text": "It looks like you could attach it to the top of the stick."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Oh, a toothbrush?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I turn it on and off several times."
				},
				{
					"text": "Each time, the stick vibrates and makes a funny sound."
				},
				{
					"text": "I stow the stick part, the one that seems to be the main part of the toothbrush, in my bag."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Is there anything else in here?"
				},
				{
					"text": "The topsiders and midsiders throw away all kinds of things that you can still use."
				},
				{
					"text": "Every time I disassemble electrical appliances, I find parts that work."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's how I get my hands on parts that you never usually see down here."
				},
				{
					"text": "If I can gather enough electronic components to make something people would want, I can barter with them in the lower market."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Hmm, is that all for today?"
				},
				{
					"text": "I get up and leave the dump."
				},
				{
					"text": "Now that work is done for the day, I just have to wait until it's time to pick up the rations."
				},
				{
					"text": "This is my little alone time."
				},
				{
					"text": "I take the stick-shaped electric toothbrush out of my bag along with my screwdriver."
				},
				{
					"text": "I insert the screwdriver into a gap in the thing's exterior, and the stick splits in two after applying some force."
				},
				{
					"text": "Inside, I find a small green plate and two tubular pieces of metal."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "It's rusty..."
				},
				{
					"text": "The pieces of metal have brown spots on them."
				},
				{
					"text": "When I press the switch, the small metal tubes begin shaking."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Whoa!"
				},
				{
					"text": "I place the shaking part on the palm of my hand."
				},
				{
					"text": "I notice a white plastic piece at the tip of the cylinder. When I touch it, the shaking stops."
				},
				{
					"text": "There's some resistance, I think."
				},
				{
					"text": "When I let go, it starts shaking again."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Oh, so it's supposed to spin? It's shaking because the middle part is out of place."
				},
				{
					"text": "I turn the switch off and remove the plastic from the tip."
				},
				{
					"text": "When I turn it on again, the part produces an even louder noise and turns around faster."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Maybe..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I could use this to make wheels turn."
				},
				{
					"text": "If I attach a wheel to the end of this, it could make a wheel move like what I saw on the monitor today."
				},
				{
					"text": "I pull out a small wheel from my bag."
				},
				{
					"text": "I found it some time ago while looking through garbage in the dump."
				},
				{
					"text": "I also take out a bit of putty I got while helping repair a water pipe in the middle side."
				},
				{
					"text": "I put some putty inside the small hole in the wheel, and then insert the rotating cylinder."
				},
				{
					"text": "I hold it together until it hardens and then let go."
				},
				{
					"text": "It's fixed in place now."
				},
				{
					"text": "Then, I turn it on."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "It's spinning!"
				},
				{
					"text": "I'm so happy I shout."
				},
				{
					"text": "The wheel spins rapidly."
				},
				{
					"text": "Just like I saw in the video. It's so fast that I can't even see the pattern in the wheel anymore."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "So if I can put three more of these together..."
				},
				{
					"text": "I can make a moving car!"
				},
				{
					"text": "This is my first step towards becoming an inventor."
				},
				{
					"text": "I smile at my little spinning wheel."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "It's amazing...."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Ah..."
				},
				{
					"text": "The bell that signals it's time to pick up the rations rings."
				},
				{
					"text": "I put the tools and parts back in my bag and run to the middle side square."
				},
				{
					"name": "Chief",
					"text": "Hey, Kaito! You manage to fix it?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Yeah, it works now."
				},
				{
					"text": "Some days ago, the nice old man that helps distribute the rations asked me to repair the flashlight he keeps attached to his belt."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "The light bulb was dead, so I replaced it with one I picked up in the dump."
				},
				{
					"text": "I hand it over, and he flips the switch to make sure it works. When the light comes on, he smiles at me."
				},
				{
					"name": "Chief",
					"text": "Oh, you're a lifesaver! I can't walk the tunnels without my little pal here."
				},
				{
					"name": "Chief",
					"text": "What can I help you with today?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I'd like some soap for washing hair. The one that smells nice and you don't need to use water with."
				},
				{
					"name": "Chief",
					"text": "Soap? Sure thing. And here's today's rations. For you and your mom."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Thanks."
				},
				{
					"name": "Chief",
					"text": "Don't drop them now! Good work, sonny."
				},
				{
					"text": "After receiving the rations, I hurry back home."
				},
				{
					"text": "Mommy's waiting for me."
				},
				{
					"text": "I have lots of things to tell her about today."
				},
				{
					"text": "I run all the way back home every day, since I know she's waiting."
				},
				{
					"text": "I want to see her as soon as possible too."
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I'm back!"
				},
				{
					"text": "When I open the door, Mom turns to me and smiles."
				},
				{
					"name": "Mom",
					"text": "Welcome home. Did you work hard today, sweetie?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Yeah! Are you hungry?"
				},
				{
					"text": "She slowly shakes her head."
				},
				{
					"name": "Mom",
					"text": "Not yet. How about you?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "Same here! Listen, I picked up a new part today."
				},
				{
					"text": "Mommy's eyes widen in surprise."
				},
				{
					"name": "Mom",

				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "I still don't have everything I need, but if I find more stuff, I can get the car moving!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Mom",
					"text": "Wow, that's amazing!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Kaito",

				},
				{

				{
					"name": "Kaito",
					"text": "But I'll show you when it's ready, okay? Not before."
				},
				{
					"name": "Mom",
					"text": "Yes, I can't wait."
				},
				{
					"text": "I go to the desk and grab something out of my bag."

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Until that time, glucose was the sole known source of energy for the brain. Since the brain is an organism that functions constantly, our bodies need to keep breaking down food for glucose to send to the brain."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "That's why our bodies have multiple layers of mechanisms to store glucose. That's the way our bodies evolved."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "On the other hand, when there's an excess of glucose and the blood sugar level rises too much, the only way to suppress it is for the body to produce insulin."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "When this natural safety check fails, a person suffers from a disease called diabetes. When humanity was still above the ground, the prevalence of diabetes in developed countries was an ever-rising concern."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",

					"text": "The evolution of a species is basically irreversible. Once a change develops, there's no way to roll it back."
				},

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "To have the self control not to overeat despite having a near inexhaustible source of food at your fingertips was perhaps valued as a symbol of spiritual virtue."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "On one hand, there was the brain and its ancestral impulse to try and secure a stable intake of glucose, and on the other, the collective aesthetic sense of humanity that dictated what body shapes were appealing."
				},
				{

				},
				{

					"text": "Sounds like a war between humankind and their brains, doesn't it?"
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "That said, that too was an achievement born from the ingenuity of the human brain. You could say the brain simply got tired of arguing with us."

				{
					"text": "There's laughter in the classroom."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Now, moving on to the discovery of paraglucose and this new process of glycolysis. What made it so revolutionary was its ability to nourish the brain, and only the brain."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "This new glycolysis process only occurred within the brain."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",

				},
				{

					"text": "Paraglucose supplied the brain with energy, but in the rest of the bloodstream, it was simply expelled as waste."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "It was tested on any number of animals, and in no case was it found to accumulate in the body."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Only the brain can make use of it, so the rest of the body just expels it."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Its properties were simply staggering. No matter how much of it you had, you wouldn't get fat, there was no risk of diabetes, and the brain was supplied with more than enough energy."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "But this was not the only reason the paraglucose exploded in popularity. Why else do you think that was?"
				},

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Its taste."
				},
				{

				},
				{
					"text": "There are some giggles and murmuring in the classroom."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Other artificial sweeteners up to that point would be, say, for example, 5000 times sweeter than sugar."
				},

					"text": "The artificial ones might seem to have an overwhelming advantage in terms of sweetness. But there was something odd about their taste."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "It's said that most people could distinguish between normal sugar and artificial sweeteners."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",

				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "Paraglucose was the only one that deceived the human tongue, and as such it was adopted almost immediately."
				},

					"text": "It spread all over the world so fast that soon, there wasn't a person out there who hadn't tasted it."
				},
				{
					"name": "Asuma",
					"text": "But what no one realized was that paraglucose was a mutagenic agent. In other words..."
				},
				{
