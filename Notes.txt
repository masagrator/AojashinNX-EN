c01_01:
	{
		"string": "２０００年に一般女性と結婚、長女をもうけたが、\\n２００７年に離婚。",
		"string_ENG": "He married his first wife in 2000, and together they had a daughter. They divorced in 2007."
	},
	In English event image included with original romfs it's stated that he married her in 1996.
	Dunno if this is typo or original year before moving timeline from high school to university (to make his daughter 4 year older).
	But in Japanese language it's 2000, so it will stay like this.

c00_03:
	three event images with English text included with original romfs have typos:
	- S(h)ingle Thinking Space
	- Image trans(e)fer
	- Data communication by b(a)io nanochip
	- "Bule" instead of "Blue"
	
	I won't fix them as they're readable anyway
